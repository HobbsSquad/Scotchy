# Scotchy
A fair bonnie app for tracking a lad or lassie's scotching

This is my first attempt at building a MEAN app.  I took up scotch as a hobby about the same time I started learning the MEAN stack. Worlds collided and this is the result.

Technically, this is really a MEN app as I haven't Angular-i-fied it yet.  The font-end is strictly EJS. Stay tuned for a new Angular version!

<strong>Install</strong>
Being a fairly basic MEaN application, installation should be fairly straightforward.  

1) Grab the repository
2) Go to root folder
3) npm install
4) npm server
5) Point your browswer at http://localhost:3000
6) Enjoy!
